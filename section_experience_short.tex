    {03/08/2022} {
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Led the design, POC (including performance, operational and development cost of studied alternatives) and implementation of a near real time metrics service to be used internally by hundreds of tool builders, giving visibility on errors, execution latency, case and API coverage (\textbf{500M+ metrics/mo}); The service is consumed by a web console (cross team) and is planned to be integrated with other services/teams of the organization - planned in a way that allows easy onboarding of new customers, data sources and new metrics;
      \item Fully designed and implemented the runtime capabilities expansion of the support tools execution platform (approx \textbf{400M execs/mo}), to conform with requirements of another segment of internal customers. The tools used by them for data analysis and consolidation can now run up to 48 hours (soft-limit), where it was only 15 min before due to previous architecture limitations;
      \item Improved existing CDK infrastructure code to use a configuration based approach to support different settings per stages and regions restrictions as part of the platform expansion into new regions with no feature parity available;
      \item Daily use of proprietary tools from Amazon to engage in development cycles: code hosting, continuous integration, unit testing, integration testing, security analysis, monitoring, and severity-based alarms.
