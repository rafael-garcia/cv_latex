  {Ongoing}
        {
        \emph{Refactoring of our content management system}\\
          \begin{itemize}
            \item The \emph{Rails} CMS platform was outdated, required a lot of maintenance effort and had a high cost to add new features;
            \item It should deal with the management and classification of partners' content up to how it is published to the apps;
            \item I've helped with the new model, and the chosen technologies;
            \item We're using \textbf{Kotlin} as the back-end technology and \emph{PostgresSQL} as the storage. For the front end we are using \textbf{Vue.js 2.x} with \textbf{Webpack} and \textbf{Sass} as the CSS Preprocessor;
            \item Started using the Karma + Mocha + Chai + Sinon test stack.\\
          \end{itemize}

  {Early 2017}
        {
        \emph{Blackhawk Gift Card Payment Integration}\\
          \begin{itemize}
            \item One of our clients needed to use Blackhawk's gift cards as a monetization platform;
            \item Participated on the solution following their specification, handling timeouts, retries and errors;
            \item I've used \textbf{Kotlin} and \emph{PostgresSQL} to implement part of it, with a retry system, by using \emph{Amazon SQS} to queue
            transactions that failed and should be fallback by Blackhawk.\\
          \end{itemize}
        }{}

  {End of 2015}
        {
        \emph{Redesign of the push notifications administration panel}\\
          \begin{itemize}
            \item The push notification system had an administration panel that was confusing for its users (very tech savvy);
            \item Together with an UX designer, some feedback from users were collected regarding the old interface and what should
            be done at the new one;
            \item I've made the code implementation of the new one, with the UX design in hands;
            \item I've used \textbf{AngularJS} and \emph{LESS} for the task, with a Bootstrap-based template.\\
          \end{itemize}

  {Late 2015}
        {
        \emph{Creation of a dashboard with data from Apps}\\
          \begin{itemize}
            \item The \textbf{AngularJS} Administration System of our platform had poor dashboard information which needed major improvements;
            \item Feedback from users were collected with an UX designer regarding the old interface and what should be done in a new one;
            \item Created a new dashboard with real-time data about DAU, MAU, app installation count, subscriptions and app reviews ratings;
          \end{itemize}
        }{}
